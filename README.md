# Password-Generator

# Summary:
For this assignment, we were asked to modify starter code to create a working password generator that will create a random password for the user based on certain critera that they've picked. The password criteria can include:
* uppercase or lowercase letters 
* special characters, like: $,@,*,or !
* or numbers
We were asked to only modify the JavaScript in order to get a full functioning, password generator. The end result was this: 

# Working with the Starter Code 
Since JavaScript is still very much new in my mind, working with not much starter code was a big obstacle, meaning that google was my best friend in this assignment. As well as the all knowing site being my homework buddy, I also used the mini-project (Rock, Paper, Scissors Game) that we created together as a class as an example/guide.

* Starting off, the generator needed to be able to create a password using uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. One of the first things that I did, was add all of the possible variables that could be used in the generator in order to create a safe and secure password using ' var '. 
    * example: var numbers = "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0," (These are the numbers that can be used.)
      This was done with all of the special case variables, as well as all the letter (uppercase and lowercase).
